## Executive Summary
- As the business  grows, there has been limited visibility into the rate at which products are being purchased over time.
- Designed an interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard that integrates 3,500+ data points to analyze KPIs, seasonal sales patterns, and customer purchasing behavior across age groups.
- Delivered a centralized and easy-to-interpret Microsoft Excel dashboard that enabled stakeholders to track over $221K in sales. The analysis revealed that Pants and Shirts are the most purchased items, while Dresses and Blouses record equal purchase volumes. It also identified peak purchasing seasons and the most preferred payment methods.

  ## Recommendations
 Based on the data analysis, I recommend the following action for the growing fashion business,

- The fashion business should increase its investment in Pants, Dresses, and Blouses, as these products generate the highest sales.

- The business should ensure adequate inventory availability, particularly during the Fall and Spring seasons, when customer demand is highest.

- Product offerings should be primarily tailored to adults, as they represent the largest segment of buyers.

- The company should focus on and strengthen the most preferred payment methods to make transactions easier and more convenient for customers, thereby improving overall purchase experience.
